**If you’re a first-time painter:**

If you want to “get your feet wet” before investing in paint supplies, dry media is acceptable. I recommend craypas. Aquarelles are water soluble and are capable of dissolving with water, giving a painting quality. Colored pencils and Crayola crayons are a good medium too. Pastels are okay if you’ve had experience with them. However, since the learning process is based on trial and error, eventually you will have to buy paints.

**Buying paint supplies**

Generally, the more money you spend, the better art supplies you can buy. It’s often best to buy high quality brushes (one each: 1” & ½”) and painting knives (2”long-1”wide to start), which you’ll use for years. Rather than buy a palette, you can use a ceramic or plastic tray. Save money by buying “student grade” acrylic paints to begin but, generally, the more money you spend on paints, the higher pigment to binder ratio you get.

You are welcome to start with crayons, oil crayons or colored pencils for any reason. However, acrylics are great for beginners because you can apply white over an area you want to change and within 10 minutes you’ll be able to re-apply color.

Generally, buy Titanium White plus a cool and a warm hue of each primary (red, yellow, blue) and secondary color (orange, green, purple). For example, you’d have a warm, fiery yellow (Cadmium Yellow Medium) and a cool, lemon yellow (Cadmium Yellow Light) in your paintbox. If you run low on funds, buy the primaries only (red, yellow, blue)- you can mix secondary colors (orange, green, purple). Please do not buy black. You’ll mix your own.

Paint manufacturers now make cadmium-free paints to avoid toxicity.
Although acrylic paint often washes out, I suggest you wear old clothes.
Other equipment includes: paper towels, container for water PLUS gessoed canvas off a roll or pre-stretched. Canvas paper and heavy drawing paper work as well.

**If you’ve painted before:**

Generally, have Titanium White plus a cool and a warm hue of each primary (red, yellow, blue) and secondary color (orange, green, purple). You don’t need black, you’ll mix your own. Oil paints are okay but, since they dry slowly, have several surfaces ready to work on. 

If you have any questions, please call, text or email us. Please let us know if you’re interested in-person or private lessons in Manhattan, NY or Zoom classes. We will inform you of the next Cover-the-White class offerings.
