Philosophy

Whether you have never painted before or have painted most of your life, Cover the White classes are personalized for you while occurring in group settings. Students progress at their own pace but benefit from sharing classmates’ understandings.

“Cover the White” refers to an instruction given during every painting class by my teacher and mentor, Sam Feinstein. His teaching was: if a painting surface remains void of color, the glaring white surface will interfere with any artistic assessment. So- just “cover the white.”

Our painting lessons will offer a broad artistic experience. Rather than focus only on artwork, this painting class focuses on the creative process. Evocative, captivating paintings are often the collateral, radiant result!

As an Art Educator, I admire the genre of young children’s art which is extraordinarily rich, communicative, captivating. In our classes, progress will be facilitated by fearless self-exploration and practice. Our painting lessons will encourage your “inner child” to express itself and have fun!

When appropriate, I will weave classic art concepts like perspective, color theory and composition throughout our lessons. CTW classes will provide a broad range of artistic instruction.

Another goal of Cover the White is to reconnect with Nature. Hans Hofmann, iconic abstract painter and premier art teacher of the 20th Century, taught my teacher, Sam Feinstein, who wrote:

“I think of Hofmann as the most religious artist of our time. Religious not in an ecclesiastical sense, of course, but religious from the Latin ‘religare.’ Hofmann gave himself over to an intimate reconnection with Nature’s process rather than its outer aspect. Nature as being more verb than noun.”

We know prehistoric artists were Shamans, gifted people connected by the unconscious to “other worlds,” who imparted healing and guidance. We have advanced scientifically during the intervening millennia and can sometimes perceive religion (religare, to reconnect) and science (scientia, to know) as unifying forces, especially in the field of quantum physics. As artists, we capture atoms moving in and out of physical form. So, whether you are a novice or seasoned painter, our classes will encourage you to see color as energy, the substrate of the physical universe, and to connect with Nature, from the quantum to the cosmic.


What happens during Cover the White Classes?

I structure CTW classes based on Sam Feinstein’s teaching model.

You will begin each session by tapping into your “inner child” and paint a “Wild One,” or free-spirited abstract as warm up. After the warm-up(s), you will move into representational or abstract mode, depending on your initial effort(s) and experience, and begin (or continue) work on a painting. Each student’s process and progress are different, so everyone receives personalized guidance throughout class. I may instruct you in a manner totally different from classmates.

While you are painting, I will play music or read from articles or books. After a while, I will ask to see your work and, in a Socratic manner, ask questions to jump start communication to illuminate your process so I can guide you. I’ll continue this process with the other participants.

At the end of class, we will have a Zoom Gallery View “Line Up” (critique) when you’re free to share any challenges, questions, successes you experienced during the session. In addition to myself, classmates will be encouraged to voice opinions and words of encouragement.
