    <p>Cover-the-White painting classes are based on Sam Feinstein’s teaching model, which he created while studying with Hans Hofmann over many decades.</p>

<p>Due to the richness of students’ differing skill sets and experiences, the structure of Cover-the-White classes is organic and non-sequential. The journey to learn to create fine art comes with dedicated, guided study in a relaxed, pleasant atmosphere. Most importantly, students journey at their own pace.</p>

<h3 id="what-happens-during-cover-the-white-classes">What happens during Cover-the-White-Classes?</h3>

<p>Tapping into the “inner child.” Students begin each session by painting a “Wild One,” or free-spirited abstract warm-up. After warming up, students are encouraged to move into representational mode. A still life is on display for this phase of class. Students are encouraged to spend half the class time painting from actuality (the still life) and half the time exploring abstraction from a visceral, playful place. Everyone’s process and progress are different, so as the instructor moves from student to student, each artist receives personalized guidance throughout Cover-the-White classes. The instructor may guide each student in a totally different manner from classmates.</p>

<p>As students are painting and “switch on” the right side of the brain (the non-verbal, spacial side), we might enjoy music. Reading to the class may illuminate art principles. At some point, the instructor walks around the classroom, asks to see everyone’s work and, in a Socratic manner, question students to jump-start communication. Conversations will illuminate each student’s process, provides guidance and unearths insights into the works of art. Although not part of Sam Feinstein’s instruction, during this process the instructor may introduce art concepts -like color theory and perspective- to elucidate how to move color energy in paintings as intended.</p>

<p>At the end of class, there will be an in-person or Zoom gallery view “Line Up” when each artist is encouraged to display artwork and share challenges, questions and successes experienced during that session. In addition to the instructor, classmates will be encouraged to voice positive opinions and words of encouragement.</p>
